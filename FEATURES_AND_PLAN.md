# MCP Daemon New Features and Implementation Plan

## New Features

*   **HTTP/2 with TLS Transport:** Implement a new transport layer using HTTP/2 secured with TLS for encrypted and efficient communication between clients and servers.
*   **WebSockets Transport:** Add support for WebSocket connections, allowing for full-duplex communication and real-time data exchange.
*   **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Transport:** Implement SSE for enabling servers to push updates to clients over a single HTTP connection.
*   **CORS Support:** Add Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) support to the HTTP/2 and WebSocket transports to allow web-based clients from different origins to interact with the daemon.
*   **Keypair Authentication:** Implement a keypair-based authentication mechanism to secure connections and verify the identity of connected clients and servers.

## Implementation Progress

Completed:
✅ Transport Layer Abstraction (traits implemented)  
✅ WebSockets Implementation (actix-ws integrated)  
✅ Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation  
✅ Keypair Authentication (ring-based implementation)  

Remaining Priorities:

1.  **HTTP/2 with TLS Completion**
    *   Finish HTTP/2 server/client implementation using hyper
    *   Add proper connection lifecycle management
    *   Implement TLS configuration handling

2.  **CORS Support**
    *   Add CORS middleware for actix-web
    *   Configure allowed origins/methods/headers
    *   Test cross-origin WebSocket connections

3.  **CLI Enhancements**
    *   Build Ratatui interface structure
    *   Implement connection management panel
    *   Add real-time monitoring displays

4.  **Testing & Validation**
    *   Create integration test suite
    *   Add load testing for WebSocket/HTTP2
    *   Verify authentication handshake security

5.  **Documentation**
    *   Write transport protocol specifications
    *   Create API reference docs
    *   Update installation/usage guides

## Chosen Technologies

*   **Web Framework (for HTTP/2, WebSockets, SSE, CORS):** `actix-web` with `actix-ws` (as you suggested).
*   **SSE Crate:** `actix-web-lab` for seamless integration with `actix-web`, or a suitable standalone crate if needed.
*   **TLS:** `rustls` or `native-tls`.
*   **Keypair Authentication:** A cryptography crate like `ring`.
*   **CLI:** `ratatui` (as you suggested).

This plan provides a roadmap for implementing the requested features. Each step will require detailed design and implementation, with thorough testing to ensure correctness and stability.
