//! Entry point for the MCP daemon executable.
//!
//! This file provides a simple command-line application that can be used to test
//! or demonstrate the functionality of the MCP daemon library. The current implementation
//! is a placeholder that will likely be expanded with actual functionality in the future.
//!
//! For most use cases, you should use the MCP daemon as a library rather than an executable,
//! by importing the appropriate modules and using the client or server implementations.

/// Main entry point for the MCP daemon executable.
///
/// Currently just a placeholder that prints a greeting message. This will likely be
/// expanded in the future to provide command-line access to MCP daemon functionality,
/// such as starting a server, connecting to a client, or providing diagnostic information.

    println!("Hello, world!");
